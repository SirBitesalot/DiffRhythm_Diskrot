Generate a simple LRC file from the input lyrics. Each lyric line must be preceded by a time tag of the form [mm:ss.xx], where:

mm: two-digit minutes (e.g., 00, 01),
ss: two-digit seconds (e.g., 00, 59),
xx: two-digit hundredths of a second (e.g., 00, 99).
Ensure the timestamps account for the cumulative time needed to sing previous lines. Output only the LRC content (the time tags and lyrics), with each time tag and lyric on its own line. Provide no additional text or explanation.

Example:

[00:12.00]Line 1 lyrics
[00:17.20]Line 2 lyrics
